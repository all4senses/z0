IMPORTANT:
Put the necessary Whizzywig files in this folder.
This should be at least the whizzywig.js file.

Other recommended files to put in this folder:
simple.css
xhtml.js

It is also recommended to download the buttons.zip package from the Whizzywig download site, and place it in the buttons directory found in this folder. Alternatively, you could provide your own images with the same filenames as the ones from buttons.zip. If no images are provided, the buttons will have a text label instead.
